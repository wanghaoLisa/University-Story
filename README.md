# University Story

One day, a well-known comedian, Silly Sally, was invited to Unimelb to complete a great challenge.  

She had to perform her show to all of the students and staff, and if she can get an average rating of 4.5/5 then she can get a free University degree. If she fails, she has to keep performing more shows until she gets the 4.5/5 rating - the catch is, she has to do the rest of the shows _naked_!

She was given three opportunities, and if she can have two shows with an average rating no less than 4.5/5, then she will win the challenge and get the free degree.

After the first show, the staff and students wants to fool her, although she performs very hard, they gave her 4.4/5.
